# Athlete Combine Dashboard

Instant athlete analysis. Zero setup. Built for coaches and scouts.

The **Athlete Combine Dashboard** is a lightweight, browser-based tool that allows coaches and scouts to quickly analyze athlete combine data using simple CSV files. Everything runs locally in the browser — no accounts, no servers, no data uploads.

This project was created to remove friction from athlete evaluation and help decision-makers focus on what actually matters: performance data and comparisons.
